## Prompt

```text
/sp.adr Undefined Project Constitution
```

## Response

```text
Three architecturally significant decisions have been identified from the planning artifacts for the "RAG Retrieval Pipeline & Validation" feature and documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). These ADRs cover the Retrieval Pipeline Core Technology Stack, Retrieval Evaluation Strategy, and the Qdrant Querying Mechanism for Pre-embedded Vectors. The process involved analyzing decision clusters, applying significance tests, and populating ADR templates with context, decisions, consequences, and alternatives. All ADRs have been created as 'Proposed' and are ready for review. ADR-0001 (Undefined Project Constitution) was referenced as an existing decision.
```

## Outcome

Three architecturally significant decisions documented as ADRs for RAG Retrieval Pipeline & Validation.

## Evaluation

Successfully created all identified ADRs by manually filling the templates due to script execution issue. All ADRs are formatted correctly and contain the required information.
