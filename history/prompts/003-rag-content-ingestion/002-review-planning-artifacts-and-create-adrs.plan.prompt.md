## Prompt

```text
/sp.adr Undefined Project Constitution
```

## Response

```text
Five architecturally significant decisions have been identified from the planning artifacts and documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). These ADRs cover Project Structure and Tooling, the RAG Pipeline Technology Stack, Semantic Chunking Strategy, External Content Acquisition, and the initial ADR for the Undefined Project Constitution itself. The process involved analyzing decision clusters, applying significance tests, and populating ADR templates with context, decisions, consequences, and alternatives. All ADRs have been created as 'Proposed' and are ready for review.
```

## Outcome

Five architecturally significant decisions documented as ADRs.

## Evaluation

Successfully created all identified ADRs by manually filling the templates due to script execution issues. All ADRs are formatted correctly and contain the required information.
