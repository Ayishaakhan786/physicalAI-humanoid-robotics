branch: master
user: user
command: Generate an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md for the feature based on available design artifacts.

Context for task generation: Create a high-level book layout (table of contents) for the Physical AI book, strictly limited to 4 modules (as specified). For each module list 4–6 chapter titles (high-level only), a 1-sentence chapter summary, and an estimated target word count per chapter. Modules: 1. Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) 2. Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) 3. Module 3 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) 4. Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Plus Preface, Hardware Appendix, Capstone Appendix, References, Glossary. Constraints: - Chapter summaries must be actionable and reproducible. - Word count targets: 800–2000 per chapter. - Include a recommended filename for each chapter (.md or .mdx) suitable for Docusaurus. Return: - A JSON object containing modules → chapters → summaries → filenames → word targets. For MODULE_X (replace with Module 1 / 2 / 3 / 4), generate a detailed chapter-level specification for every chapter in the module. For each chapter include: - Chapter title and filename - Learning objectives (3–5) - Required pre-knowledge - Step-by-step lab tasks (high-level steps) - Code snippets to include (list of files and short description) - Diagrams to create (text description + suggested filename) - Tests/Validation criteria (what to run to confirm reproducibility) - Sources (primary docs, links) in APA format Constraints: - Code must be compatible with Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS 2 Humble/Iron (state which). - Labs must be reproducible with Jetson Orin as optional target. - Keep each chapter spec ≤ 400–800 words. Return: - A folder-like spec for the module with chapter specs in Markdown. Generate a Docusaurus project skeleton (file tree + sample files) for the book. Include: - /docs/ - /module-01-ros2/ - 01-intro.md - 02-ros-architecture.md - ... - /module-02-digital-twin/ - /module-03-isaac/ - /module-04-vla/ - hardware-appendix.md - capstone.md - README.md - /assets/ (images, urdf, usd-descriptions) - sidebars.js (populate with the chapter filenames) - package.json (basic Docusaurus dependencies) - README with build & deploy steps (npm install, npm run build, npm run deploy) Constraints: - All docs must be .mdx compatible. - Insert the Docusaurus docs reference link at the top of README: https://docusaurus.io/docs - Place a placeholder for the GitHub repo URL: https://github.com/Ayishaakhan786 Return: - A tree listing + the content of sidebars.js and README.md (copy-pasteable). Produce a task list suitable for SpecifyPlus to auto-generate content in chunks. Each task must include: - Task ID - Input: chapter spec (from Step 5) - Generation instruction: produce chapter body in Markdown/MDX - Word target: per chapter - Required artifacts: code files, diagrams, URDF files - QA checks: run code lint, ensure commands run (simulate by listing commands to run locally), APA citations included - Output path: docs/module-XX/filename.md Chunking rules: - Max 1200 words per generation job - Prefer generating theory and lab as separate tasks for each chapter - After generation, queue a QA task for technical verification and Docusaurus build test Return: - A JSON/CSV of tasks ready to import into SpecifyPlus. Create a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) that: - Runs on push to main - Installs Node.js - Runs npm ci - Builds Docusaurus (npm run build) - Runs a basic smoke test (check that index.html exists in build) - Deploys to GitHub Pages (gh-pages branch) using actions/configured-deploy - Uses GitHub secrets for any API tokens (do NOT place keys inline) - Adds a step to run a docs broken-links check (npm run docusaurus swizzle or link checker) Also provide the YAML content and steps to add repository secrets in GitHub (GH_TOKEN or GH_PAGES_TOKEN). Return: - Full deploy.yml ready to paste into repo. Produce a QA checklist and acceptance test plan: - Per-chapter acceptance criteria (list) - End-to-end capstone reproducibility test (step-by-step commands) - URDF unit tests (what to verify in RViz/Gazebo) - Isaac Sim checks (what logs/frames to inspect) - Whisper + LLM pipeline test (sample utterance and expected action breakdown) - Docusaurus build & link checks Produce the checklist as Markdown and a small CSV of test commands for instructors to run locally.

## Response snapshot

Generated a detailed, dependency-ordered task list for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book. The tasks are organized into setup, foundational, user story phases, and a polish phase, adhering to the specified checklist format. The task list is located at 'specs/001-robotics-book-spec/tasks.md'.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Generated a detailed, dependency-ordered task list for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book.
- 🧪 Tests: Tasks follow the specified format, user stories are well-defined.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/001-robotics-book-spec/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to begin execution of tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Continued challenges with `run_shell_command`'s interaction with bash scripts, necessitating agent-native PHR creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` (bash script) not executable on Windows directly via `run_shell_command`.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (Internal validation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement a PowerShell equivalent for `create-phr.sh` or use `pwsh` directly in `run_shell_command` to execute the bash script.
