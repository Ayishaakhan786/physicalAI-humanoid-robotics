## Response snapshot

Updated the 'specs/001-robotics-book-spec/tasks.md' file to incorporate detailed content generation instructions for all chapter writing tasks, as well as for the preface, appendices, references, and glossary. These tasks are now explicitly marked as incomplete and ready for execution by a content generation tool, ensuring adherence to the specified academic tone, formatting, and content requirements for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Updated `tasks.md` to incorporate detailed instructions for content generation tasks, making them ready for execution.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (Refactoring task)
- 📁 Files: Modified `specs/001-robotics-book-spec/tasks.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for execution of content generation tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully integrated detailed content generation instructions into existing tasks, preparing `tasks.md` for the next phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` (bash script) not executable on Windows directly via `run_shell_command`.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (Internal validation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement a PowerShell equivalent for `create-phr.sh` or use `pwsh` directly in `run_shell_command` to execute the bash script.
