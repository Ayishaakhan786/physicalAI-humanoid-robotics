**Chapter Title**: Introduction to Digital Twins in Robotics
**Filename**: 01-intro.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1200-1500 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Define what a digital twin is in the context of robotics and its key components.
- Understand the benefits of using digital twins for robot development, testing, and deployment.
- Identify various types of robotic simulation environments (e.g., Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim).
- Explore real-world applications of digital twins in different robotics domains.
- Differentiate between simulation, digital model, and digital twin.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts.
- Familiarity with the Linux command line (for future labs).
- General programming concepts.

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Research and compare different robotic simulation platforms based on features and use cases.
- Outline a basic architecture for a digital twin of a simple robotic arm.
- Install a basic simulation environment (e.g., Gazebo or Unity).

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `simulation_platform_comparison.json`: JSON file outlining key features of various simulation platforms.
- `robot_arm_digital_twin_architecture.drawio`: Diagram file (or similar text representation) for a basic digital twin architecture.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: Hierarchy of simulation, digital model, and digital twin. Suggested filename: `digital_twin_hierarchy.png`.
- Diagram: Lifecycle of a robot with an integrated digital twin, showing design, simulation, physical deployment, and data feedback loop. Suggested filename: `robot_digital_twin_lifecycle.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Successful installation of at least one simulation environment.
- Ability to articulate the differences between simulation types.
