# Chapter Spec: URDF and Robot Models

**Module**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
**Chapter Title**: URDF and Robot Models
**Filename**: 03-urdf-models.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1500-1800 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Understand the structure and syntax of URDF (Unified Robot Description Format).
- Create a URDF model for a simple robotic arm or mobile robot from scratch.
- Define robot kinematics (links and joints) and visual/collision properties.
- Load and visualize URDF models in `rviz2`.
- Integrate URDF models into Gazebo simulations.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic understanding of Gazebo simulation (from previous chapter).
- Familiarity with XML syntax.
- Basic concepts of robot kinematics (links, joints, degrees of freedom).

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Design a simple 2-DOF robotic arm or a 2-wheeled mobile robot on paper.
- Write the URDF file for the designed robot, defining its links, joints, and visual/collision properties.
- Use `check_urdf` tool to validate the URDF syntax.
- Launch the URDF model in `rviz2` for visualization and verify its kinematics.
- Spawn the URDF model in Gazebo and verify its physical properties.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `my_robot.urdf`: URDF file for a simple 2-DOF robotic arm or mobile robot.
- `display_my_robot.launch.py`: ROS 2 launch file to display `my_robot.urdf` in `rviz2`.
- `spawn_my_robot_in_gazebo.launch.py`: ROS 2 launch file to spawn `my_robot.urdf` in Gazebo.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: URDF hierarchical structure (root link, child links, joints). Suggested filename: `urdf_hierarchy.png`.
- Diagram: Key elements of a URDF link (visual, collision, inertial). Suggested filename: `urdf_link_elements.png`.
- Diagram: Key elements of a URDF joint (parent, child, axis, limits). Suggested filename: `urdf_joint_elements.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- `check_urdf` tool reports no errors for the created URDF file.
- `rviz2` correctly displays the robot model with correct joint limits and transforms.
- Robot model spawns in Gazebo without errors and exhibits basic physics (e.g., falls due to gravity).
