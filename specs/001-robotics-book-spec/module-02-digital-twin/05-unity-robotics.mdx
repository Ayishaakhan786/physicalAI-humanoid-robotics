# Chapter Spec: Introduction to Unity Robotics Hub

**Module**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
**Chapter Title**: Introduction to Unity Robotics Hub
**Filename**: 05-unity-robotics.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1800-2000 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Understand the benefits of using Unity for high-fidelity robotics visualization and simulation.
- Install and configure Unity Hub and the Unity Robotics Hub packages.
- Integrate ROS 2 with Unity using the ROS-TCP-Connector.
- Import and control simple robot models within a Unity environment.
- Create custom Unity scenes for robotics simulation.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic understanding of Digital Twins and simulation concepts.
- Familiarity with ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics, services).
- Basic C# or Python programming concepts.
- Familiarity with Unity Editor (optional, but helpful).

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor.
- Create a new Unity project and install Unity Robotics Hub packages (ROS-TCP-Connector, URDF Importer).
- Import a simple URDF robot model (e.g., from previous chapter or a sample) into Unity.
- Set up ROS 2 communication between a Unity scene and an external ROS 2 node.
- Control the imported robot model from a ROS 2 teleoperation node.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `unity_ros_tcp_setup.md`: Markdown file detailing Unity Hub, Editor, and ROS-TCP-Connector setup steps.
- `UnityRobotController.cs`: C# script for controlling a robot in Unity via ROS 2 topics.
- `ros2_teleop_unity.py`: Python ROS 2 node for sending commands to Unity robot.
- `unity_urdf_import_process.md`: Markdown file outlining the URDF import process into Unity.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: Communication bridge between Unity and ROS 2 using ROS-TCP-Connector. Suggested filename: `unity_ros2_bridge.png`.
- Diagram: Unity Editor layout for robotics simulation, highlighting key windows (Scene, Hierarchy, Inspector, Project). Suggested filename: `unity_editor_layout.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Unity Editor launches successfully with Robotics Hub packages installed.
- URDF robot model successfully imports into Unity.
- ROS 2 topics successfully communicate between Unity and external ROS 2 nodes.
- Robot model in Unity responds correctly to ROS 2 control commands.
