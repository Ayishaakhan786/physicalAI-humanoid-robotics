# Chapter Spec: Gazebo Simulation Basics

**Module**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
**Chapter Title**: Gazebo Simulation Basics
**Filename**: 02-gazebo-sim.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1500-1800 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Install and configure Gazebo Classic or Gazebo Garden (based on ROS 2 Humble compatibility).
- Understand the Gazebo user interface and basic controls.
- Launch and interact with pre-existing robot models (e.g., TurtleBot3) in Gazebo.
- Create simple Gazebo environments with primitive shapes and terrains.
- Perform basic sensor data visualization within Gazebo.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic understanding of Digital Twins and simulation concepts (from previous chapter).
- Familiarity with the Linux command line.
- Basic ROS 2 concepts (nodes, topics) for potential future integration.

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Install Gazebo Classic (recommended for ROS 2 Humble) and its ROS 2 bridge.
- Launch a pre-configured Gazebo world with a simple robot.
- Use Gazebo GUI to move the robot, inspect sensor data, and manipulate objects.
- Create a custom `.world` file in Gazebo with a ground plane and a few static objects (e.g., box, cylinder).
- Save and load Gazebo world states.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `install_gazebo_classic_ros2_humble.sh`: Shell script for Gazebo Classic installation and ROS 2 bridge setup.
- `simple_world.world`: XML definition of a basic Gazebo world.
- `launch_turtlebot3_world.launch.py`: ROS 2 launch file to bring up TurtleBot3 in a Gazebo world.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: Gazebo user interface components (viewport, object tree, plugins panel). Suggested filename: `gazebo_ui.png`.
- Diagram: Flow of a Gazebo simulation, highlighting physics engine, sensor simulation, and rendering. Suggested filename: `gazebo_simulation_flow.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Successful launch of Gazebo with a robot model.
- Robot can be teleoperated or manipulated within the simulation.
- Custom Gazebo world loads correctly with defined objects.
- Sensor data (e.g., lidar, camera) is visible and plausible in Gazebo.
