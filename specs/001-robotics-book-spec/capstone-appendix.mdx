# Chapter Spec: Capstone Appendix: Project Guidelines

**Module**: Appendices and Miscellaneous
**Chapter Title**: Capstone Appendix: Project Guidelines
**Filename**: capstone-appendix.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1500-2000 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Understand the scope and expectations for the book's capstone project.
- Learn how to propose, plan, and execute a robotics project using the acquired knowledge.
- Identify key milestones and deliverables for a successful capstone.
- Familiarize with best practices for project documentation, version control, and collaboration.
- Understand how to evaluate the success of a robotics project.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Completion of all main modules (ROS 2, Digital Twin, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA).
- Strong understanding of robotics development principles.

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Develop a project proposal for a robotics application, outlining goals, methodology, and expected outcomes.
- Create a detailed project plan, including tasks, timelines, and resource allocation.
- Implement a small-scale capstone project using components from at least two modules.
- Document the project process, results, and future work.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `capstone_project_template.md`: Markdown template for a project proposal.
- `project_gantt_chart_example.drawio`: Example Gantt chart (or similar text representation) for project planning.
- `capstone_ros2_pkg_template.zip`: Zipped template for a ROS 2 package structure suitable for a capstone.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: Robotics project lifecycle (concept, design, implement, test, deploy). Suggested filename: `robotics_project_lifecycle.png`.
- Diagram: Capstone project architecture, showing integration points between modules. Suggested filename: `capstone_arch_overview.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Project proposal meets specified criteria.
- Project plan includes detailed tasks and timelines.
- Implemented capstone project demonstrates integration of multiple modules.
- Project documentation is clear, concise, and comprehensive.

## Sources (primary docs, links) in APA format
- Project Management Institute (PMI) guidelines (pmi.org).
- Agile methodologies for project management (e.g., Scrum Guide).
- Academic papers on robotics project management.
- Best practices for software engineering documentation.
