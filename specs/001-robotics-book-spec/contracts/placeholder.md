# Contracts for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

This directory is intended to contain API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas) if the feature involved external interfaces.

For the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" project, there are no external APIs or data contracts in the traditional software development sense. The "contracts" are implicitly defined by the content structure, file formats (Markdown/MDX), and the Docusaurus platform itself.

Therefore, this file serves as a placeholder.
