# Chapter Spec: Introduction to ROS 2

**Module**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
**Chapter Title**: Introduction to ROS 2
**Filename**: 01-intro.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1200-1500 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Understand the concept of a Robot Operating System (ROS) and its evolution to ROS 2.
- Identify the key advantages of using ROS 2 for robotics development.
- Recognize the role of middleware (DDS) in ROS 2 communication.
- Familiarize with the ROS 2 development environment setup (Ubuntu 22.04, ROS 2 Humble).
- Gain an overview of the book's structure and the modules covered.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic understanding of Linux command-line interface.
- Fundamental programming concepts (variables, loops, functions) in Python or C++.
- General interest in robotics and automation.

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Setting up the development environment: Install Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS 2 Humble.
- Verify ROS 2 installation by running basic demo commands (e.g., `ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker`).
- Explore the ROS 2 documentation and community resources.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `install_ros2_humble.sh`: Shell script for automated ROS 2 Humble installation steps.
- `verify_ros2_install.py`: Python script to check for successful ROS 2 setup.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: Evolution of ROS to ROS 2, highlighting key architectural changes and benefits (e.g., DDS). Suggested filename: `ros2_evolution.png`.
- Diagram: High-level overview of the ROS 2 ecosystem (tools, client libraries, middleware). Suggested filename: `ros2_ecosystem_overview.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Successful execution of `ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker` and `ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener` in separate terminals.
- Environment variables (`ROS_DISTRO`, `AMENT_PREFIX_PATH`) are correctly set after sourcing ROS 2 setup files.

## Sources (primary docs, links) in APA format
- ROS 2 Documentation: Foxy, Galactic, Humble, Iron references (docs.ros.org).
- Open Robotics Official Website (www.openrobotics.org).
- DDS (Data Distribution Service) specification overview (e.g., from OMG).
