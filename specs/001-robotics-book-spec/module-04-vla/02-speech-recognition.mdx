# Chapter Spec: Speech Recognition for Robotics (Whisper)

**Module**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Chapter Title**: Speech Recognition for Robotics (Whisper)
**Filename**: 02-speech-recognition.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1500-1800 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Understand the principles of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and its role in human-robot interaction.
- Explore the capabilities and limitations of models like OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text conversion.
- Implement real-time speech transcription from a microphone input using Whisper.
- Integrate Whisper's output into a basic ROS 2 system for command processing.
- Evaluate the performance of ASR models in noisy robotic environments.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic understanding of VLA concepts (from previous chapter).
- Python programming skills.
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (nodes, topics).
- Basic audio processing concepts (optional).

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Set up a Python environment with Whisper and necessary audio libraries.
- Transcribe audio from a WAV file using a pre-trained Whisper model.
- Implement a real-time speech transcriber that listens to microphone input.
- Create a ROS 2 node that publishes transcribed text to a ROS 2 topic.
- Test Whisper's transcription accuracy with various spoken commands and background noise.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `whisper_transcriber.py`: Python script for transcribing audio from file or microphone.
- `ros2_whisper_node.py`: ROS 2 node that uses Whisper for real-time speech transcription and publishes to a topic.
- `command_parser_node.py`: ROS 2 node subscribing to transcribed text and printing parsed commands.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: ASR pipeline from audio input to transcribed text, highlighting Whisper's role. Suggested filename: `asr_whisper_pipeline.png`.
- Diagram: ROS 2 integration of Whisper, showing audio input, Whisper node, and text topic. Suggested filename: `ros2_whisper_integration.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Whisper model successfully transcribes sample audio files with high accuracy.
- Real-time microphone input is accurately transcribed.
- ROS 2 node publishes transcribed text to a topic.
- Transcribed commands can be successfully received and processed by a ROS 2 subscriber.
