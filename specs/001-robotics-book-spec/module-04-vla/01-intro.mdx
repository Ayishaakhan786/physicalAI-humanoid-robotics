**Chapter Title**: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Filename**: 01-intro.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1200-1500 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Understand the concept of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and its significance in advanced robotics.
- Identify the core components of a VLA system: computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action planning.
- Explore the challenges and opportunities in integrating vision, language, and action for intelligent robot behavior.
- Review existing VLA frameworks and research trends.
- Differentiate VLA from traditional robotics control paradigms.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts.
- Familiarity with computer vision fundamentals.
- Basic knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) concepts.
- General programming concepts (Python recommended).

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Research current VLA projects and papers.
- Outline a conceptual VLA pipeline for a household robot.
- Review available open-source tools or libraries for vision, language, and action components.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `vla_pipeline_conceptual.drawio`: Diagram file (or similar text representation) outlining a VLA pipeline.
- `vla_research_summary.md`: Markdown summary of recent VLA advancements.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: The VLA triangle, illustrating the interplay between Vision, Language, and Action. Suggested filename: `vla_triangle.png`.
- Diagram: High-level VLA system architecture, showing data flow from perception to decision to action. Suggested filename: `vla_system_arch.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Ability to articulate the components and flow of a VLA system.
- Identification of key research directions in VLA.
