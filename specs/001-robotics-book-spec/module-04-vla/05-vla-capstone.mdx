# Chapter Spec: VLA Capstone Project: Bringing It All Together

**Module**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
**Chapter Title**: VLA Capstone Project: Bringing It All Together
**Filename**: 05-vla-capstone.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1800-2000 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Integrate all VLA components (speech recognition, NLU, action planning) into a cohesive robotic system.
- Design an end-to-end VLA pipeline for a complex human-robot interaction scenario.
- Implement robust error handling and feedback mechanisms for VLA systems.
- Evaluate the overall performance and usability of a VLA-enabled robot.
- Understand challenges and future directions in VLA research and application.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Understanding of speech recognition, NLU, and action planning (from previous chapters).
- Python programming skills.
- Familiarity with ROS 2.
- Experience with simulated robot environments (Gazebo, Isaac Sim).

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Define a complex multi-turn human-robot interaction scenario (e.g., "Robot, please clear the table. Start with the red cup.").
- Integrate the Whisper ASR node, NLU parsing node, and task planning node into a single ROS 2 system.
- Develop a control interface for a simulated mobile manipulator robot to execute the VLA commands.
- Implement visual feedback (e.g., highlighting detected objects) and verbal feedback (e.g., "Okay, I will clear the table.") from the robot.
- Test the end-to-end VLA pipeline with various commands, including edge cases and ambiguities.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `vla_system_launch.py`: ROS 2 launch file to bring up the entire VLA pipeline.
- `vla_feedback_node.py`: ROS 2 node for verbal and visual feedback from the robot.
- `complex_interaction_scenario.md`: Markdown document detailing the capstone scenario.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: End-to-end VLA system architecture, showing all integrated components and data flow. Suggested filename: `vla_end_to_end_arch.png`.
- Diagram: Human-robot interaction loop for a VLA system, including verbal commands, robot perception, decision, and action. Suggested filename: `hri_vla_loop.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- The VLA system correctly interprets complex multi-turn commands.
- The simulated robot executes the intended sequence of actions based on VLA commands.
- Robust error handling is demonstrated for ambiguous or unsupported commands.
- Robot provides appropriate feedback during interaction.
- Overall system demonstrates intelligent and intuitive human-robot interaction.
