# Chapter Spec: Robot Integration and Control in Isaac Sim

**Module**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
**Chapter Title**: Robot Integration and Control in Isaac Sim
**Filename**: 03-robotics-isaac.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1500-1800 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Import and configure existing robot models (e.g., from URDF) into Isaac Sim.
- Understand how to control robot joints and actuators using the Isaac Sim Python API.
- Implement ROS 2 control for robots simulated within Isaac Sim.
- Simulate basic sensors attached to robots (e.g., camera, lidar).
- Develop simple teleoperation interfaces for Isaac Sim robots.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic understanding of Isaac Sim environment setup and Python scripting (from previous chapter).
- Familiarity with URDF/USD robot models.
- ROS 2 programming concepts (nodes, topics, services).
- Python programming skills.

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Import a sample URDF robot (e.g., Franka Emika Panda) into an Isaac Sim scene.
- Write a Python script to control the robot's joints using a simple trajectory.
- Set up ROS 2 bridge for Isaac Sim and integrate a ROS 2 teleoperation node to control the robot.
- Add a simulated camera to the robot and view its output.
- Record robot movements and sensor data from within Isaac Sim.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `import_urdf_robot.py`: Python script to import and stage a URDF robot.
- `joint_control.py`: Python script demonstrating direct joint control of a robot.
- `isaac_ros2_teleop.py`: Python ROS 2 node for teleoperating an Isaac Sim robot.
- `isaac_sim_camera_feed.py`: Python script to visualize simulated camera output.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: Data flow for ROS 2 control of an Isaac Sim robot, highlighting the ROS 2 Bridge. Suggested filename: `isaac_sim_ros2_control.png`.
- Diagram: Isaac Sim sensor integration pipeline (sensor component, physics simulation, data output). Suggested filename: `isaac_sim_sensor_pipeline.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Robot model successfully imports and stages in Isaac Sim.
- Robot joints move according to programmed trajectories.
- ROS 2 teleoperation commands correctly control the simulated robot.
- Simulated camera feeds are visible and update realistically.
