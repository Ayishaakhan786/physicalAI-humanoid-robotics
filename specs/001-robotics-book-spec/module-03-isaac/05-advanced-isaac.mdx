## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Implement multi-robot simulations within Isaac Sim.
- Explore advanced physics interactions and material properties for realistic simulation.
- Integrate external AI frameworks or custom algorithms with Isaac Sim.
- Utilize Isaac Sim for large-scale synthetic data generation campaigns.
- Understand the concepts of Domain Randomization for robust AI training.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Understanding of perception and AI concepts in Isaac Sim (from previous chapter).
- Python programming skills.
- Basic understanding of multi-agent systems and distributed computing (optional).

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Create a multi-robot scene in Isaac Sim, controlling each robot independently or cooperatively.
- Design custom physics assets (e.g., deformable objects, liquids) and integrate them into a scene.
- Connect Isaac Sim to an external machine learning framework (e.g., PyTorch) to send sensor data and receive control commands.
- Set up a synthetic data generation pipeline using replicators for various lighting, textures, and object poses.
- Apply domain randomization techniques to a training scene.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `multi_robot_control.py`: Python script for controlling multiple robots in Isaac Sim.
- `custom_physics_asset.usd`: USD file defining a custom physics asset.
- `external_ai_integration.py`: Python script for interfacing Isaac Sim with an external AI framework.
- `synthetic_data_replicator_config.py`: Python script configuring a large-scale synthetic data generation using replicators.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: Multi-robot simulation architecture in Isaac Sim, showing communication paths. Suggested filename: `isaac_sim_multi_robot.png`.
