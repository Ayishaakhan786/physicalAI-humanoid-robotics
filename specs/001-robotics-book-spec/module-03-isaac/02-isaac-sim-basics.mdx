# Chapter Spec: Isaac Sim Environment Setup and Basics

**Module**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
**Chapter Title**: Isaac Sim Environment Setup and Basics
**Filename**: 02-isaac-sim-basics.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1500-1800 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Configure Isaac Sim for custom development, including Python environment setup.
- Understand the Python API for Isaac Sim (OmniGraph, Omniverse Kit).
- Create basic scenes programmatically using the Python API.
- Manipulate objects (position, rotation, scale) within Isaac Sim via scripting.
- Implement basic physics interactions and material properties.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic understanding of Isaac Sim interface and concepts (from previous chapter).
- Python programming skills.
- Familiarity with 3D concepts (transformations, coordinates).

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Set up a dedicated Python environment for Isaac Sim scripting.
- Write a Python script to create a simple scene with a ground plane and a falling sphere.
- Use the Python API to change object properties (e.g., color, friction).
- Load an external USD file into an Isaac Sim scene via scripting.
- Run a simple simulation, record, and playback.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `create_falling_sphere.py`: Python script to create a ground plane and sphere with physics.
- `object_manipulation.py`: Python script demonstrating programmatic control of objects.
- `load_external_usd.py`: Python script to load a custom USD model.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: Isaac Sim Python API structure (omni.isaac.core, omni.usd, omni.physx). Suggested filename: `isaac_sim_python_api.png`.
- Diagram: Scene graph hierarchy in USD, illustrating how objects are parented. Suggested filename: `usd_scene_graph.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Python scripts execute without errors in the Isaac Sim environment.
- Programmatically created scenes load correctly with expected objects and physics.
- Objects can be manipulated as intended by scripts.
- External USD models load and render correctly.
