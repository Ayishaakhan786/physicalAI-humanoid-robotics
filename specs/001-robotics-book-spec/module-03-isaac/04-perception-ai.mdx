## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Utilize Isaac Sim's advanced sensor models for realistic perception data generation.
- Implement basic computer vision tasks (e.g., object detection, segmentation) using synthetic data from Isaac Sim.
- Understand the process of synthetic data generation for training AI models.
- Integrate AI models (e.g., from PyTorch, TensorFlow) with Isaac Sim for real-time inference.
- Explore Reinforcement Learning (RL) workflows within Isaac Sim.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Understanding of robot integration and control in Isaac Sim (from previous chapter).
- Basic Python programming skills.
- Fundamental knowledge of computer vision and machine learning concepts.
- Familiarity with PyTorch or TensorFlow (optional).

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Configure Isaac Sim sensors (RGB-D camera, Lidar) to generate realistic synthetic data.
- Collect synthetic images and annotations (bounding boxes, segmentation masks) from Isaac Sim.
- Train a simple object detection model using the collected synthetic data (using pre-trained models or a small custom dataset).
- Deploy the trained AI model in Isaac Sim for real-time inference on simulated sensor streams.
- Implement a basic RL environment in Isaac Sim to train a robot to perform a simple task.
