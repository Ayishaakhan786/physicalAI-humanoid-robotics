## Phase 0: Research

### Decision: ROS 2 Distribution

-   **Decision**: ROS 2 Humble (LTS)
-   **Rationale**: ROS 2 Humble is a Long Term Support (LTS) release, offering greater stability, longer-term maintenance, and broader community support compared to Iron. This is crucial for an educational book targeting a capstone course, where stability and a well-established ecosystem are paramount for reproducible tutorials and minimizing troubleshooting for students and instructors.
-   **Alternatives considered**: ROS 2 Iron. Rejected due to its shorter support cycle and potentially less mature tooling/community support, which could lead to more friction for learners in an educational context.
