**Module**: Appendices and Miscellaneous
**Chapter Title**: Hardware Appendix: Jetson Orin Setup
**Filename**: hardware-appendix.mdx
**Word Count Target**: 1500-2000 words

## Learning Objectives (3-5)
- Understand the capabilities and variants of the NVIDIA Jetson Orin platform.
- Learn how to set up and configure a Jetson Orin device for robotics development.
- Install necessary software and drivers for ROS 2 and other key libraries on Jetson Orin.
- Troubleshoot common setup issues with Jetson Orin devices.
- Explore best practices for optimizing performance on Jetson Orin.

## Required Pre-knowledge
- Basic Linux command-line interface skills.
- Familiarity with hardware setup concepts (e.g., flashing OS images).
- Understanding of ROS 2 installation (from Module 1).

## High-level Lab Tasks
- Flash the JetPack SDK onto a Jetson Orin developer kit.
- Install ROS 2 Humble on the Jetson Orin.
- Configure network settings for communication between Jetson and host PC.
- Run a basic ROS 2 example (e.g., `turtlesim`) directly on the Jetson Orin.
- Optimize Jetson Orin power modes and performance settings.

## Code Snippets to Include (list of files and short description)
- `flash_jetson_orin.sh`: Shell script for flashing JetPack (high-level steps).
- `install_ros2_jetson.sh`: Shell script for ROS 2 Humble installation on Jetson.
- `jetson_power_modes.sh`: Shell script to switch Jetson power modes.

## Diagrams to Create (text description + suggested filename)
- Diagram: Jetson Orin developer kit board layout, highlighting key ports. Suggested filename: `jetson_orin_layout.png`.
- Diagram: Software stack on Jetson Orin (JetPack, CUDA, cuDNN, ROS 2). Suggested filename: `jetson_software_stack.png`.

## Tests/Validation Criteria
- Jetson Orin successfully boots with JetPack.
- ROS 2 Humble runs correctly on the Jetson Orin.
- Basic ROS 2 examples (e.g., `turtlesim`) execute without errors on the device.
- Power mode switching functions as expected.
