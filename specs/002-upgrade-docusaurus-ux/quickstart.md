# Quick Start: Running the Docusaurus Book

This guide provides the basic steps to run the Docusaurus development server and view the UI/UX changes locally.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually included with Node.js)

## Setup and Execution

1.  **Navigate to the book directory**:
    From the root of the repository, change into the `book` directory.
    ```bash
    cd book
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Install all the necessary npm packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server**:
    Start the Docusaurus development server. This will open the book in a new browser tab, and the site will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

The local development server will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
